# Becquerel - Beta Controller
Bec is a bot created to manage our bots' beta programs and the other utilities surrounding them. While the bot is tailored specifically to our needs, they're also free to be used by others with similar needs

# Features
## Server entry management
This bot is set up to handle an entry application tied in with an entry role and generated entry codes. This allows you to handle a closed beta and know how many times a code has been used by others.

## Program handling
Bec has commands for handling beta programs automatically, allowing you to create programs and post them to a channel for users to enter and exit as they please.

# Self-hosting
